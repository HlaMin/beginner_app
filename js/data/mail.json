Then, it goes on talking about the newer products that did\r<br />even better.\r<br />\r<br />Of course, Nathan being able to pull it off the first time doesn't mean\r<br />that I can. But I can see how my product (SaaS Compass) would be more\r<br />valuable to old/large companies than new/small ones. I was thinking I could\r<br />make a mini-version by dropping off the parts than handle the full\r<br />marketing funnel and the churn.\r<br />\r<br />But the comment about \"artificially crippling\" my product kinda hit home\r<br />too.\r<br />\r<br />While price safariing, I was looking at\r<br />Starting+Sustaining<http://startingandsustaining.com>.\r<br />It could have easily sold the book for $79 and had an extra package (maybe\r<br />$149, or even $199) with the spreadsheet, based on the comments given about\r<br />the pricing.\r<br />\r<br />The other comparison point I found is\r<br />SaaSOptics<http://www.saasoptics.com/Pricing/Saas_optics_pricing.html>.\r<br />Their clumsy-looking \"collect SaaS data from QuickBooks, perfect\r<br />replacement for .xls\" system is priced based on customer revenue and ranges\r<br />from $2,500 to $10,000 per year. To my great surprise, people are loving\r<br />this. No complaints about the price.\r<br />\r<br />So, I'd be tempted to price the sheet at around $250, but I'm worried that\r<br />the small guys will not want to spend that much... yet, they could get\r<br />value from this as well. The real customer value for this one should be in\r<br />thousands, but I can't price *that* high - it varies a lot how much value a\r<br />company is going to get.\r<br />\r<br />I'm pretty worried that if I offer only the higher price point, I may lose\r<br />more than half of all potential customers. Or then I just can't see this\r<br />clearly and could take patio11's advice and double the price...

They just want to look like they have a<br />credible negotiating position<br /><br />The other hosting company also probably know this.  So they will lo-ball<br />you cos they don't care.  Which means you need to have three answers ready<br /><br />- why, technically you out do the other guys.  This is the usual nice PDF<br />about your hosting, how it's on two different AWS locations on either<br />coast, how you can get hot failover up in 0.3 micro-parsecs etc.<br />This one is important because everyone will pretend its the reason they<br />take your service, so it has to be credible.  Use at least two diagrams<br />from that Apple only diagramming tool<br /><br />- why you really are cheaper even though you charge more (this is a<br />combination of assumptions about licenses, future outages and speed to fix,<br />future features that will gain them x% conversion improvements they won't<br />see with other hosting company.  Again this is an excuse - but it needs to<br />be credible, so frankly the conversion rate improvements seem best bet.<br /><br />- and finally, the real reason- I wrote it dumpkopfs!<br /><br /><br />But they will come back to you, soon, with \"these other guys said ...\".<br /> Hit them hard and fast with the above three and your fat daily rates<br />before the hosting company gets mental space as the unchallenged hosting<br />provider (seen this from the other side a couple of times - the faster a<br />rebuttal gets into the heads of everyone in the decision chain the less<br />opposition there is.  )<br /><br />Don't wait to fire these back and ring up everyone you know - seriously I<br />have seen the internal debate turn in a few hours either way.  If folks go<br />home Friday evening with the decision set at \"the other guy is choice #1<br />right now, lets see what Ethan says\" by Monday morning you are facing a<br />fixed decision to go with the others.  If they go home with \"the other guy<br />is #1 choice but Ethan has raised some very good TCO issues\" then on Monday<br />they will meet and say \"but I was thinking over the weekend that there are<br />some TCO issues we need to consider\"<br /><br />Good luck.

The timing of this project worked out really<br />well for me.  I was about to start a full-time job with a company that was<br />really adamant about me not moonlighting as a consultant.  The friend that<br />approached me about the job needed a web developer to do a purchasing<br />validation server.  I wasn't able to custom build that as a consultant, but<br />it occurred to me that if it were a product, then it would fly as a \"prior<br />invention.\"  That might have been bending the spirit of the full-time job,<br />if not the letter.  I was originally going to do it for no pay, because I'd<br />get a sellable product out of it.  Some money came out of it though, so<br />that was just gravy.<br /><br />@Vitaly - I'd love to hear other people's results with this approach, so if<br />it comes up again, please do share!  When I first heard \"productize your<br />services,\" I thought that meant this model.  I think a few consultancies<br />have done this with CMSs for example.  locomotivecms (a Rails CMS) was<br />built for this reason, I think.<br /><br />@Joel - Master negotiator I am not.  They basically got the right to do<br />anything they wanted with the deliverable.  They could turn around and sell<br />it themselves if they wanted to.  That worked for me, because their<br />business is art and video game development, and not running a SaaS product.<br /> If that were, they would have just done it themselves, I figured.  Plus,<br />they won't get updates to the code.  I did retrain the right to keep<br />selling it on my own though.  Also, when it's up and running, they'll need<br />someone to keep it running, and I think I have a good opportunity to land a<br />retainer.  The current arrangement is that I just hand them working code,<br />but just as they don't know how to write it, they don't have the<br />organizational expertise to even host it just for themselves.  They have a<br />\"hosting company\" that made an offer to them.  I plan to make an offer<br />that's higher, with the competitive advantage being, \"who do you want<br />making sure you're able to sell things in your game?  A hosting company, or<br />the company that wrote your purchase server?\"  I'll word it a bit more<br />gracefully than that, but I would rather pay for the team that wrote it.<br /> They'd also get updates as a result that way.<br /><br /><br />On Tue, Jun 11, 2013 at 8:33 AM, joelhooks@gmail.com <joelhooks@gmail.com>wrote:<br /><br />> Hey Ethan,<br />><br />> I was wondering what sort of licensing terms you came up with for this?

(I didn't take attendance,<br />but felt a count might be useful.)<br /><br />Useful to know day-to-day class schedule, syllabus<br />Awareness of other mentor skills so we can get help for mentee where we're<br />weak<br />Generally would be good to formalize mentoring/mentee expectations, close<br />feedback loop on performance<br />More structure around time spent, interaction expectations, communication<br />channels, possibly periodic checkins (incl daily standups)<br />Small commits, pushing to github often, use github infra (incl issues as<br />TODO/FIXME) more<br />Formal instruction \"should\" cover:<br />  breaking things down into parts/outlining/understanding tradeoffs<br />  debugging<br />Junior mentors feel unqualified to help (new students better prepared at<br />entry due to growing app pool)<br />Feeling of competition between peers (due to differing entry qualification,<br />progress rate, differing amounts of mentor attn, etc)<br />Hiring is not about liking you, it could be: company situation, skillset,<br />support system, finance runway/burn/timing<br />Tell mentees that feedback on mentors is welcome, and that mentors can be<br />\"fired\" and replaced<br />Rebalancing mentor/mentee through program would help (some mentors were<br />more and less available, some mentees wanted more help than others)<br />More visibility into staff roles and contact info<br />Companies w/ mature junior onboarding should be more visible (so that other<br />partners can learn from it)<br />Better partner company expectation setting - many partners \"window<br />shopping\" for best rather than looking to grow promising entries<br />  Tom's crazy #1: (I didn't capture this accurately): something to do with<br />the program running internship itself<br />  Tom's crazy #2: Related to partner co expectation setting, instructors<br />could \"mock interview\" at partner cos and give feedback on what would/would<br />not be fair assessments.  Would help fit program results to hiring hopes.<br /><br />Input from former students (i.e. the junior mentors) about their experience<br />as mentees:<br />  * didn't know the kind of help they needed or could ask for<br />  * a regular schedule helps, as time flies<br />  * a channel for sharing tips/tricks/timesavers would help (I think this<br />could just be a student mailing list/subject protocol: subj: [tip] ... ?)<br />  * code review a very valuable form of feedback (add mentors to github<br />repos)<br />  * weekly project digest<br /><br />Christian's bias to backend hurts some aspects<br /><br />Moon: candidates from previous classes still looking, need cohort<br />support/backing<br /><br />Jeremy Crazy #1:<br />  A bunch of feedback centered around saying the program should do more of<br />X.  Given resource constraints, I think it'd be useful to have a mechanism<br />for prioritizing those suggestions.  I'll populate a google moderator with<br />tech/skills/comms to cover, to be voted on by mentors (and presumably<br />instructors).  Final decision up to staff, of course.<br /><br />Partner companies need guidance on offers/expectations.  Wide variance in<br />per-student expectation, wide variance in company offer ($ and further<br />mentoring).<br /><br />Jeremy crazy #2: there are a bunch of pro women-in-tech orgs.  People in<br />those orgs work at potential hiring partners.  They could be \"people on the<br />inside\".  Work with them?   Put another way, let's work with ada initiative<br />people to make internal contacts at more orgs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />On Thu, May 30, 2013 at 11:48 PM, Tom Hughes-Croucher <<br />tom.croucher@gmail.com> wrote:<br /><br />> Yep.
