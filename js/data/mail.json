The length\nseems great; long enough to get into some details, but not overly verbose.\n I did note a couple things while reading it that might be helpful for you\nto know about, or might just be me.\n\nThe first thing that popped to my attention is your blog headline \"Automate\nyour business and watch it grow without hiring another employee.\" is\nimmediately followed by your article title \"How to hire the top 1% of\noutsourcers\".  I'm wasn't sure what this article would be about anymore,\nbecause it seems to be about not hiring people, and then hiring people.\n\nThe article equates hiring \"outsourcers\" with hiring a VA.  Is that the\nonly kind of outsourcing people do?  I thought this article might be\nrelevant to outsourcing software development from the title, but it doesn't\nseem to be what you're going for.\n\nI'm also confused by the term \"oursourcer\".  \"outsourcer\" implies to me a\nperson or organization who procures resources from outside of the country.\n This article seems like it uses \"outsourcer\" to refer to the procured\nperson, not the procuring person.  Is that just my lack of familiarity with\nthe correct jargon? :-)\n\nMathieu\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jun 10, 2013 at 2:18 PM, Nick Karrasch <nickkarrasch@gmail.com>wrote:\n\n> Hey all,\n>\n> Here's my first ebomb:\n> http://42insights.com/how-to-hire-the-best-outsourcers/.

I remember back in  the early days - when all of this was just an\nidea - and it has been a lot of fun to consult with him along the way - and\nnow to have it fleshed out into awesome content that suits his audience.\n It's geared toward people that already have a list and a following - so\nit's not a 100% fit for this list.\n\nEarlier today - David and I were on a call - and I mentioned\nthe consultancy group - and asked him if a bunch of the members were\ninterested - if I could sweet talk him into doing a special webinar for\nthat group - or something like that - and David said that he'd think about\nit after launch when it quiets down.  So he gave me an affiliate link -to\nuse for tracking - to see if there's a group that's interested.  I can't\nmake promises - but here's the link if it's something that you're\ninterested in.  therise.ontraport.net/t?orid=680&opid=3  and yes, if you\nsign up, he's going to add you to the email list and send you the \"VIP\nlaunch email and video sequence\".\n\nI've seen the launch sequence - and there is some really good solid free\nmaterial in it - so if you are interested - it's worth the email to get the\nfree stuff (as well as you can save the email/video sequence as a swipe\ncampaign.    Swipe files make it so much faster when you're ready to create\nyour own material - you wouldn't believe the difference and the time\nsavings.   I can't tell you how many of the campaigns that I've done with\nRamit Sethi's products - that started out as a permutation of another\ncampaign (his or someone else's) - and the same goes for the sales pages.\nIt's one of those things that everyone doesn't always talk about openly -\nand it's a tactic that is a huge time saver.\n\nHope that you enjoy it as a resource!\n\nRachel\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jun 10, 2013 at 4:09 PM, marcus@marcusneto.com <\nmarcus@marcusneto.com> wrote:\n\n> I'm just catching up on some of the email from last week and I have to\n> agree with Brennan.

Randomtype is\npresently churning out work at a rate that is great for the pocket book but\nleaves us with virtually no down time to invest in products (I know that I\nactually do have time, just haven't made room for it yet).  I remember\nBrennan saying that when he pushed out Planscope it wasn't good enough for\nhim to build in his down time, it had to be blocked off efforts diverted to\nproduct development (which is exactly how we build products.. the logic\nholds).\n\nThis brings me to the question... what is the threshold everyone is waiting\nfor to jump from *consulting -> product(s)*? Are you waiting for $XXXX to\npull the trigger? Are you waiting for the right team?

It was born out of\nbeing approached to do a contract job.  The pay for that job wasn't\nstellar, so I suggested I'd just build the thing as a product that I'd\nlicense to the client.  That arrangement has worked quite well, and I\nbasically got a resellable product that someone else footed a lot of the\nbill for.  It also worked nicely, because since it was originally a\ncontract job, I knew it was something that someone would at least pay\nsomething for.\n\nI personally am waiting to have at least a few team members before scaling\ninto other products.  If I do launch a product, I want to make sure I'm not\nthe only person responsible for responding to emergencies.\n\n\nOn Mon, Jun 10, 2013 at 5:51 PM, Vitaly Kushner <vitaly@astrails.com> wrote:\n\n> I know that for me its definitely X/month figure, we (all 3 partners) all\n> have families (2 kids each) and live in a not-very-cheap neighbourhood.

The mail open rates are lower too\nand I get less shares & feedback.\n\nSeries and pain-killing is a hard combination. I took a nice pain, wrote a\ngigantic article, split it - and later on noticed that the pain had diluted\nbadly.\n\nAs ebomb's purpose is to draw people in, it's not effective to offer them\nthe same pain/topic several times in a progression. Even though we are\nteaching, this is about selling (the articles), getting attention and\nmaking people act.\n\nFrom pain-killing point of view, series leaves the reader disappointed.
